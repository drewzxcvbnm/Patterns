# Patterns
Authored by Andris Zacs for the purpose completing Java Roadmap (Object Oriented Design Patterns)

Classes that implement a pattern are marked with a comment of the following format:<br> Pattern : \<Pattern name\> (\<Pattern type\>)

Example:
```
/**
 * Pattern : Factory method (Creational)
 */
```
